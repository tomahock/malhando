malhando
========

This is supposed to be a app to manage a malha tournament

Using
======
 - initializr from http://html5boilerplate.com/
 - twitter bootstrap
 - node.JS
 - socket.io
 - node-mysql by Felix Geisend√∂rfer - https://github.com/felixge/node-mysq
 - mysql

Running
======
Edit configure.php and app.js to set your database configs
Edit admin.js and client.js to set your socket address correctly

run node app.js


Hint
======
Since i'm using nginx on my server, i'm catching all requests on port 8080 and using proxy_pass directive to send "~ /socket.io" request to port 3000 (setted on app.js). 
This is necessary because node.JS can't parse php so nginx parses php for node.JS and node.js just be node.JS
